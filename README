King of Fighters '98UMFE and 2002UM hitbox viewer

To compile with MinGW: make.bat
Compilation with Visual Studio currently not yet tested.

TODO:
- Update Makefile to work for both native Windows and Linux cross-compilation with MinGW.
  - GCC/Cygwin compilation support?
- Identify guard-type boxes and "running throw"-type boxes.
- Configuration options (e.g., box colors, box fill on/off)
- Look into API hooking.
  - Does Microsoft Detours play well with MinGW?
  - Possible MinGW-friendly alternative: https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook
    - http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/44326/MinHook-The-Minimalistic-x-x-API-Hooking-Libra
- Maybe integrate the Steam Anti-Anti Debugger?

- Support KOF 2002UM's Type A graphics setting (sprites are scaled differently in Type A)

Known issues:
- Pivots/hitboxes don't show up in Steam screenshots (probably solved by API hooking).
