King of Fighters '98UMFE and 2002UM hitbox viewer

To compile with MinGW: make.bat
Compilation with Visual Studio currently not yet tested.

TODO:
- Figure out where actual hitbox data is located in memory.
- Look into API hooking.
  - Does Microsoft Detours play well with MinGW?
  - Possible MinGW-friendly alternative: https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook
    - http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/44326/MinHook-The-Minimalistic-x-x-API-Hooking-Libra
- Switch to DirectX instead of raw GDI (it's just way too slow)
- Maybe integrate the Steam Anti-Anti Debugger?

Known issues:
- Sporadic bouts of flickering, sometimes severe.
- Pivots don't show up in Steam screenshots (probably solved by API hooking).
