King of Fighters '98UMFE and 2002UM hitbox viewer

To compile with MinGW: make.bat
Compilation with Visual Studio currently not yet tested.

TODO:
- Find throwboxes and projectile boxes in memory.
- Proper box type determination and coloration with alpha transparent box fills.
- Find out how to detect and automatically conceal "ghost" leftover hitboxes.
- Proper hitbox layering based on type.
- Configuration options (e.g., box colors, box fill on/off)
- Look into API hooking.
  - Does Microsoft Detours play well with MinGW?
  - Possible MinGW-friendly alternative: https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook
    - http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/44326/MinHook-The-Minimalistic-x-x-API-Hooking-Libra
- Maybe integrate the Steam Anti-Anti Debugger?

- Support KOF 2002UM's Type A graphics setting (sprites are scaled differently in Type A)

Known issues:
- Pivots don't show up in Steam screenshots (probably solved by API hooking).
